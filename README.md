# Note
This is a fork of the original VascuSynth software with support for generating larger-than-main memory volumes.

# VascuSynth - Vascular Tree Synthesis Software
Preet S. Jassi, May 5 2011

Please visit the Insight Journal and read the paper here http://www.insight-journal.org/browse/publication/794 for proper instructions on how to compile and execute VascuSynth.  VascuSynth requires CMake and ITK.  Instructions on how to install CMake and ITK are in the paper above.  

After you have installed CMake and ITK, use CMake to create a Makefile by selecting the source in this directory.  Using either Visual Studio or the command line, compile VascuSynth.  

Once VascuSynth has compiled, you can issue a command similar to the one below to execute VascuSynth:

./VascuSynth paramFiles.txt imageNames.txt 0.04 <cubic_volume_size> testNoise.txt

Please read the Insight Journal paper for any additional information or feel free to contact me!
